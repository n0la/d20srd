  description: >-
    This creature seems to be about the size of a pony. It has four insectlike
    legs and a squat humped body protected bya thick lumpy hide. Its tail is
    covered with armour plates and ends in a bony projection that looks like a
    double ended paddle. The creature sports two long antennae on its head, one
    beneath each eye.
