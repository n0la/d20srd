  description: >-
    Dangerous predators of the tundra and other chill regions, winter wolves
    pursue prey relentlessly. They rarely give up the chase until they bring
    down their quarry.
    Winter wolves are more intelligent than their smaller cousins, and sometimes
    associate with other evil creatures of their cold homelands, such as frost
    giants, whom they serve as scouts, hunters and trackers.
    A winter wolf grows about 8 feet long and stands about 4-1/2 feet at the
    shoulder. It weighs about 450 pounds.
    Winter wolves can speak Giant and Common.
