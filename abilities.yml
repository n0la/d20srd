    An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with
    the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus
    bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra
    2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows
    one negative level on any lawful creatureattempting to wield it.
    The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and
    disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative
    level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
    overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the
    weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow
    the chaotic power upon their ammunition.

    activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with
    reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon
    accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she
    moves physically or by magical means. If the wielder who loosed it
    has an unoccupied, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own

    not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost
    ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold
    damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical
    multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead,
    and if the modifier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows,
    and slings so crafted add the cold energy upon their ammunition. Even
    if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still does extra cold
    damage on a successful critical hit.

  description: >-
    This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. For instance, if
    it is placed on a longsword (which has a normal threat range of
    19-20), the keen longsword scores a threat on a 17-20. Only piercing
    or slashing weapons can be keen. This benefit doesn't stack with any
    other effect that expands the threat range of the weapon (such as the
    keen edge spell or the Improved Critical feat).
