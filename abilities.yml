  description: >-
    An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with
    the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus
    bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra
    2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows
    one negative level on any lawful creatureattempting to wield it.
    The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and
    disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative
    level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
    overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the
    weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow
    the chaotic power upon their ammunition
