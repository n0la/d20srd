    This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to
    use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature
    struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use
    the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the

    strikes.

    a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus
    (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning
    special ability. It can be hurled with a 30-foot range
    increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 2d8 points of damage
    against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other

    xp: 2179
  description: >-
     This +3 frost greatsword sheds light as a torch when the
     temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed
     when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is
     protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of
     fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.  A
     frost brand extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a
     standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not
     instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check
     (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such
     spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

  description: >-
     This +2 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy cold iron longsword
     in the hands of a paladin. It provides spell resistance of 5 +
     the paladin’s level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It
     also enables the wielder to use greater dispel magic (once per
     round as a standard action) at the class level of the
     paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted
     dispel or counterspell versions of greater dispel magic.)

    price: 20320
    xp: 1600
  description: >-
     This +1 greataxe is favored by undead and constructs, who do not
     suffer its drawback. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels
     on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had
     been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck,
     subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level
     or lose a character level. Each time a life-drinker deals damage
     to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any
     negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1
     hour.

    This +2 short sword gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all
    saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune,
    usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its
    possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the
    result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original
    roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain up to three wishes
    (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4-1 wishes, minimum
    0). When the last wish is used, the sword remains a +2 short
    sword, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll
    power.
