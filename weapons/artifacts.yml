    This black +1 dagger has a serrated edge. It allows the wielder to
    use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature
    struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use
    the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the

    strikes.

    This weapon commonly functions as a +2 warhammer. In the hands of
    a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus
    (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning
    special ability. It can be hurled with a 30-foot range
    increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 2d8 points of damage
    against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any other

    xp: 2179
  description: >-
     This +3 frost greatsword sheds light as a torch when the
     temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed
     when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is
     protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of
     fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.  A
     frost brand extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a
     standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not
     instantaneous effects, though you must succeed on a dispel check
     (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such
     spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

    xp: 4800
  description: >-
     This +2 cold iron longsword becomes a +5 holy cold iron longsword
     in the hands of a paladin. It provides spell resistance of 5 +
     the paladin’s level to the wielder and anyone adjacent to her. It
     also enables the wielder to use greater dispel magic (once per
     round as a standard action) at the class level of the
     paladin. (Only the area dispel is possible, not the targeted
     dispel or counterspell versions of greater dispel magic.)

    price: 20320
    xp: 1600
  description: >-
     This +1 greataxe is favored by undead and constructs, who do not
     suffer its drawback. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels
     on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had
     been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck,
     subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level
     or lose a character level. Each time a life-drinker deals damage
     to a foe, it also bestows one negative level on the wielder. Any
     negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion lasts for 1
     hour.

  description: >-
    This +2 short sword gives its possessor a +1 luck bonus on all
    saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune,
    usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its
    possessor to reroll one roll that she just made. She must take the
    result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original
    roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain up to three wishes
    (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4-1 wishes, minimum
    0). When the last wish is used, the sword remains a +2 short
    sword, still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its reroll
    power.

  craft:
    price: 39312
    xp: 2880
  description: >-
    This +3 adamantine heavy mace has a +5 enhancement bonus against
    constructs, and any critical hit dealt to a construct completely
    destroys it (no saving throw). A critical hit dealt to an outsider
    deals ×4 damage rather than ×2.

- name: Mace of Terror

  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Fear]
  price: 38552
  craft:
    price: 19276
    xp: 1542
  description: >-
    On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder’s clothes and
    appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such
    that living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a
    fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). They take a -2 morale penalty on
    saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use
    this ability up to three times per day.

- name: Nine Lives Stealer
  type: Longsword
  school: necromancy
  alignment: evil
  grade: strong
  cl: 13
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Finger of Death]
  price: 23057
  craft:
    price: 11528
    xp: 922
  description: >-
    This longsword always performs as a +2 longsword, but it also has
    the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this
    nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword
    becomes a simple +2 longsword (with a hint of evil about it). A
    critical hit must be dealt for the sword’s death-dealing ability
    to function, and this weapon has no effect on creatures not
    subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20
    Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the
    sword’s death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the
    ability is expended, and normal critical damage is
    determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting
    to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels
    remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the
    sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in
    actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way
    (including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.

- name: Oathbow
  type: Composite Longbow
  school: evocation
  grade: strong
  cl: 15
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  price: 25600
  craft:
    price: 13100
    xp: 1000
  description: >-
    Of elven make, this white +2 composite longbow (+2 Str bonus)
    whispers "Swift defeat to my enemies" in Elven when nocked and
    pulled. Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target
    (a free action), the bow’s whisper becomes the low shout "Swift
    death to those who have wronged me." Against such a sworn enemy,
    the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it
    deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and ×4 on a critical hit
    instead of the normal ×3). However, the bow is treated as only a
    masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and
    the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon
    other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for seven
    days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder
    of the oathbow, whichever comes first. The oathbow may only have
    one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a
    target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target
    or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn
    enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate
    the oathbow’s special power again until 24 hours have passed from
    the time he made the oath.

- name: Rapier of Puncturing

  spells: [Harm]
  price: 50320
  craft:
    price: 25320
    xp: 2000
  description: >-
    Three times per day, this +2 wounding rapier allows the wielder to
    make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points of
    Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to
    critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this
    weapon.

- name: Screaming Bolt
  type: Bolt
  school: enchantment
  grade: faint
  cl: 5
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Doom]
  price: 267
  craft:
    price: 128
    xp: 10
  description: >-
    One of these +2 bolts screams when fired, forcing all enemies of
    the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on a
    DC 14 Will save or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear
    effect.

- name: Shatterspike
  type: Longsword
  school: evocation
  grade: strong
  cl: 13
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Shatter]
  price: 4315
  craft:
    price: 2315
    xp: 160
  description: >-
    Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use Shatterspike as a +1
    longsword only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a +4
    bonus (including the sword’s +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed
    roll when attempting to strike a foe’s weapon. If successful,
    Shatterspike deals 1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder’s
    Strength modifier to the target weapon (the target weapon’s
    hardness must still be overcome with each hit). Shatterspike can
    damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.

- name: "Shifter's Sorrow"
  type: Two-Bladed Sword
  school: transmutation
  grade: strong

  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Baleful Polymorth]
  price: 12780
  craft:
    price: 6780
    xp: 480
  description: >-
    This +1/+1 two-bladed sword has blades of alchemical silver. The
    weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature
    with the shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature
    in an alternate form (such as a druid using wild shape) is struck
    by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 Will save or return to its
    natural form.

# TODO: Slaying Arrow/Bolt

- name: Sleep Arrow
  type: Arrow
  school: enchantment
  grade: faint
  cl: 5
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Sleep]
  price: 132
  craft:
    price: 69
    xp: 5
  description: >-
    This +1 arrow is painted white and has white fletching. If it
    strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead
    bursts into magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the
    same amount as would be lethal damage) and forces the target to
    make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.

- name: Sun Blade
  type: Bastard Sword
  school: evocation
  grade: moderate
  cl: 10
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Daylight]
  price: 50335
  craft:
    price: 25335
    xp: 2000
  description: >-
     This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade
     is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and
     ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers
     to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the
     wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword.)
     Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short
     sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun
     blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short
     sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those
     feats do not stack.  In normal combat, the glowing golden blade
     of the weapon is equal to a +2 bastard sword. Against evil
     creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy
     Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double
     damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2).  The
     blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the
     wielder can swing the blade vigorously above her head while
     speaking a command word. The sunblade then sheds a bright yellow
     radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance begins shining
     in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward
     at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe
     of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging,
     the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute
     before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good
     alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains
     one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the
     sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer
     wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss,
     but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration
     spells) while the sword is wielded.

  craft:
    price: 12875
    xp: 1029
  description: >-
    This black iron +2 longsword bestows a negative level when it
    deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary hit
    points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These
    temporary hit points last for 24 hours. One day after being
    struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each
    negative level or lose a character level.

    xp: 893
  description: >-
    This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on the Material
    Plane, but on any Elemental Plane its enhancement bonus increases
    to +2. (The +2 enhancement bonus also applies on the Material
    Plane when the weapon is used against elementals.) It operates as
    a +3 longsword on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when
    used against opponents native to either of those planes. On any
    other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a +4
    longsword.

  description: >-
    The magical properties of this +1 trident with a 6-foot-long haft
    enable its wielder to charm up to 14 HD of aquatic animals (Will
    DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by
    the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30
    feet apart. The wielder can use this effect up to three times per
    day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a
    speak with animals spell. Animals making their saving throw are
    free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet of the
    trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.

  description: >-
    A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the
    location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680
    feet. A trident of warning must be grasped and pointed in order
    for the character using it to gain such information, and it
    requires 1 round to scan a hemisphere with a radius of 680
    feet. The weapon is otherwise a +2 trident.
