    An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with
    the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus
    bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra
    2d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. It bestows
    one negative level on any lawful creatureattempting to wield it.
    The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and
    disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative
    level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
    overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the
    weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow
    the chaotic power upon their ammunition.

    considered wielded or attened by the creature for all maneuvers
    and effects that target items  (such as the sunder action or a heat
    metal spell). While dancing, it takes up the same space as the
    activating character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with
    reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon
    accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she
    moves physically or by magical means. If the wielder who loosed it
    has an unoccupied, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own
    as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can't dance (attack
    on its own) again for 4 rounds.

    It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment.
    It bestows one negative level on any evil creature attempting to
    wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand
    and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative
    level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome
    in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is
    wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the holy
    power upon their ammunition.

    An icy burst weapon function as a frost weapon that also explodes
    with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does
    not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost
    ability, an icy burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of cold
    damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical
    multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead,
    and if the modifier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows,
    and slings so crafted add the cold energy upon their ammunition. Even
    if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still does extra cold
    damage on a successful critical hit.

    This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. For instance, if
    it is placed on a longsword (which has a normal threat range of
    19-20), the keen longsword scores a threat on a 17-20. Only piercing
    or slashing weapons can be keen. This benefit doesn't stack with any
    other effect that expands the threat range of the weapon (such as the
    keen edge spell or the Improved Critical feat).

  description: >-
    The magic weapon serves as a channel for the wielder\'s ki, allowing
    her to use her special ki attacks through the weapon as if they were
    unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk\'s stunning attack,
    ki strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat.
    Only melee weapons can have the ki focus ability.

    The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it
    deals is non lethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this
    ability until commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings
    so crafted bestow the merciful effect upon their ammunition.

  description: >-
    This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be
    thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the
    creature that threw it. It returns to the thrower just before the
    creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again in that
    turn). Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free
    action. If the character can't catch it, or if the character has
    moved since throwing it, the weapon drops to the ground in the
    square from which it was thrown.

  description: >-
    Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers
    towards its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise
    apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the
    weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an enemy
    space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if
    they are nearby.)

    Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity.
    The electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until
    another command is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of
    electricity damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings
    so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition.

    A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that also
    explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit.
    The electricity does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra
    electricity damage from the shock ability, a shocking burst weapon
    deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity damage on a successful
    critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra
    2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is
    x4, add  an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted
    bestow the electricity energy upon their ammunition. Even if the
    shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra
    electricity damage on a successful critical hit.

  spells: [Haste]
  modifier: 3
  description: >-
    When making a full attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon
    may take one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder's
    full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the
    situation. (This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects,
    such as a haste spell.)

- name: Spell Storing
  slots: [weapon]

  feats: [Craft magic Arms and Armor]
  modifier: 1
  description: >-
    A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single
    targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must
    have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes
    a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can
    immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if
    the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the
    general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as
    long as casting that spell normally.) Inflict serious wounds,
    contagion, blindness, and hold person are all common choices for
    the stored spell. Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a
    spell caster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level
    into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of
    the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing
    weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already.

  modifier: 1
  description: >-
    A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon
    striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm
    the wielder. A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic
    damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical
    multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic damage instead,
    and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage.
    Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the sonic energy upon
    their ammunition. Subjects dealt a critical hit by a thundering
    weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened permanently.

  description: >-
    An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes the
    weapon evil aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage
    reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of
    good alignment. It bestows one negative level on any good creature
    attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the
    is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This
    negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
    overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon
    is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy
    power upon their ammunition.

  description: >-
    When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash of
    disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the
    wielder. This energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the
    opponent and 1d6 points of damage to the wielder. Only melee weapons
    can be vicious.

  feats: [Craft magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Circle of Death, Keen Edge]
  modifier: 5
  description: >-
    This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the heads
    of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a
    successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the
    opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such
    as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as
    golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not affected
    by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when
    their heads are cut off. The DM may have to make judgement calls
    about this sword's effect. A vorpal weapon must be slashing weapon.
    (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon,
    reroll.)

    A wounding weapon deals 1 point of constitution damage from blood
    loss when it hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the
    Constitution damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as
    plants and constructs) are immune to the Constitution damage dealt
    by this weapon.
