  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Animate Objects]
  modifier: 2
  description: >-
    Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder,
    protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both
    her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A
    character with an animated shield still takes any penalties
    associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell
    failure chance, and nonproficiency.

- name: Arrow Catching

  grade: moderate
  cl: 8
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Entropic Shield]
  modifier: 1
  description: >-
    A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a
    deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles
    and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or
    thrown weapon aimed at a target wihin 5 feet of the shield's wearer
    diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer
    instead. (If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker,
    the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, those
    attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that
    would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an
    enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus or not
    diverted to the wearer (but the shield's increased AC bonus still
    applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or
    deactivate this ability with a command word.

- name: Arrow Deflection
  slots: [shield]
  school: Abjuration
  grade: faint
  cl: 5
  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Shield]
  modifier: 2
  description: >-
    This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows
    feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged
    weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has
    an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he
    succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the
    attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon
    doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as
    boulders hurled by giants or Melf's Acid Arrows, can't be deflected.

  shield:
    category: [light, heavy]

  feats: [Craft Magic Arms and Armor]
  spells: [Bull\'s Strength]
  modifier: 1
  description: >-
    A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield
    bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two
    size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points
    of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The
    shield acts as +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy
    shields can have this ability.)

    This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement
    bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal
    creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by incoroporeal
    creatures at any time. Incorporeal creatures gain the armor and
    shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal
    attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.
